            <img class="picture" src="danielle.jpg" alt="A picture that may not show up (from Facebook)">
            <p>This is Danielle Clark. She comes from the Valleys, in Wales, where she lived with her [family].
                 Now she lives in London, and works remotely for Ten10 (based in Leeds). She studied physics at QMUL
                 and said I was her best friend in the area between Leeds and London. She owns Jackbox but can't stream it, 
                has one(?) flatmate/housemate, and I'm running out of things to say!</p> 
            <p>Throughout the years she has experimented a lot with her hair.</p>
